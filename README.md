# Cube3D-RepRapped
A conversion of the Cube3D printer by 3D Systems to use the RepRap tools

The Cube3D by 3D Systems is a discontinued 3D printer. The printer, like many 3D Systems products has a locked-down ecosystem of controls and filament.
While the printer was ~1200USD at launch, they can be found used on eBay for around 100USD.

The mechanics of the printer are very good, and it has linear rails, 24-volt rated stepper motors, diecast frame, and plenty of space to mount components.

For this project, I am challenging myself to use several different design tools such as FreeCAD, Fusion360, Descartes, and OpenSCAD.
